# Emulator for Witcher:OldWorld
These are my personal notes made during development of this project

# Update 
So I realised its probably better to do the board game options for players first, then from each choice the player makes we can generate a whole Board State, as well as possible Moves the player can Take.

There is no point implementing choices for moves rn, since these should be managed by different Heuristics.

# Update
The curent Implementation has a choice tree for the AI at the different stages of play, the choices get evaluated using heuristics

# Update
A possible

# Goal
Currently focsuing on creating the Traversal part of the game that is present in **Phase 1 : Movement and Action**
