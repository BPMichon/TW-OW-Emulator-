  ## This is what the AI would do right? As Human players we just decide based on our current Hand.

#     possible_moves = []

#     for loc in  self.current_location.adjacent_locations:
#         # Move to a location for 1 Card First, then prioritize 1 card 1 gold, then 2 cards
#         # Assign value to location based on if they are traversable
#         # Choose the lowest value
#         # Then Discard Card (Which one to discard? Check strength between cards?? Evaluate Hand Strength)
#             destination : Location = locations[loc]
#             terrain_needed = destination.terrain
#             cost_options = []
